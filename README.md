# Laboratory work N*1
## Tasks
1. Firstly, I downloaded library of *boost* from 'https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.69.0/boost_1_69_0.tar.gz' using **wget**.
2. Then by 'tar -xvf' I unarchived file to directory '~/boost_1_69_0'
3. Using 'tree -L 1' I counted, how many files are in directory '~/boost_1_69_0'

4. 'tree' helped me to count all diractories and files in '~/boost_1_69_0'. It show me tree of files and in the end of command I found total number.

  -We can also use command 'ls' with parametres '-a', '-l', '-R', and command 'grep "^-"' which helps to avoid directories for tasks number **3** and **4**.

5. To find neccessary files I used command 'find' and folowing **conditions**.

  -I could also used parametre 'type -f' to find only files without directories.
6. -If we want to find all files with name **any.hpp** we need use command 'find'.

   -If we want to find full path to file in only this directory we need use 'realpath'.

7. Using 'grep -rl "boost::asio" ~/boost_1_69_0/boost' we output to consol all files that contain sequence **boost::asio**.
8. I used './bootstrap.sh --prefix=boost-libs', created './boost-libs' in '~/boost_1_69_0'. Then I used '.b2 install' to compile *boost*.
9. To output all file and their sizes in this directory we can use 'tree -h' or 'ls -Rlh'.
10. -Firstly, I used 'du -ahS | sort -rh | head -5', but then I understood that -S do not count sizes of subdirectories but it do not ban output of  directories.

    -So, I decided to use 'find -type f -print | argvs ls -lh | sort -k5,5 -rh | head -5'.
